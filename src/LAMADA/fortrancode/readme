=========================================================================

Use and Liability
-----------------

Use of the accompanying LAMBDA software is allowed, but no liability for the 
use of the software will be accepted by the authors or their employer, the 
Delft University of Technology.
Giving proper credits to the authors is the only condition posed upon the use 
of the LAMBDA software.
We ask you to refrain from passing the software to third parties; instead you 
are asked to pass our (E-Mail) address to them, so we can send the software 
upon their request. The reason is, that in this way we have a complete 
overview of the users of the software, enabling us to keep everyone informed
of the latest developments. 


Implementation
--------------

The implementation is described in LGR report No 12: `The LAMBDA method for 
integer ambiguity estimation: implementation aspects'.
Instead of aiming for utmost efficiency, our goal has been to make an 
implementation that is clear and that has a one-to-one correspondence to the 
report. 
For the accessing scheme of the matrices, we use the standard Fortran 
2-dimensional array, even in the case where the matrix is symmetric or 
triangular.
We are sure that still some efficiency can be gained, but for educational 
reasons, as well for reasons of easy software maintenance we refrained from 
that.


Testing and Updates
-------------------

We welcome any suggestion for improvement of the code, the in-source 
documentation and the description in the report.
We also would like to encourage you to communicate to us about results 
obtained with the LAMBDA method, and comparisons made with other methods.
We would also be much obliged if you would inform us when you would decide
to use the method commercially. As said before, there are no restrictions
on that, other than properly acknowledging the designers of the method
and their employer.  
At this moment, several implementations in other computer languages (C, C++,
Matlab) have been derived from this Fortran version; none of them has been 
made public yet however. 
If you are planning to make a version in an other language, and would like to
make it public, we would like you to contact us, in order to coordinate the 
efforts. 
Updated information about the LAMBDA method will be available at
